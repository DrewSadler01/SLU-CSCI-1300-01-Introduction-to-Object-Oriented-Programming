Brief overview of program, including any known bugs:
Known bug is for symmetric is that it will work even for a blank name.
Easiest find smallest integer that equals the same sum of the smallest integer multiplied by N, i used a function to simplify it down.
Symmetric organizes a list with the shortest lengths at top and bottom and largest in the middle, and each pairs in the list on opposite ends of the print. I made this with "substrings" in python and messing with the printing order and range.
Terrace determines the sizes of the groups which attempted to enter the terrace during a party, when people left the terrace, and how many times a group was denied entry to the terrace. I did this by sorting it into a map, and running that list through a certain function.
Everywhere accepts a certain amount of locations, then prints out the distinct locations in the amount given. did this by comparing each input to one another and impementing it.
